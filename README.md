🍎 Fruit Quality Prediction using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview

Fruit Quality Prediction is a deep learning–based image classification system that identifies whether a fruit is fresh or rotten using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model analyzes fruit images and automatically predicts their quality, helping in reducing food waste and improving quality control in agricultural and retail industries.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of computer vision and deep learning techniques for real-world applications.
